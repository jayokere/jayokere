# Hi there, I'm Jermaine Acho Okere! 👋

### 🚀 Analytical Software Engineer | MSc Systems Engineering Student

[cite_start]I am a Computer Science graduate with **First-Class Honours** [cite: 5, 48][cite_start], currently pursuing my **MSc in Software Systems Engineering at UCL**[cite: 45, 46]. 

[cite_start]I specialise in building **high-performance, scalable systems** and developer tooling[cite: 6]. [cite_start]My passion lies in solving complex problems—whether that's optimising low-latency trading engines or designing dynamic pathfinding algorithms for mobile[cite: 6, 28, 37].
