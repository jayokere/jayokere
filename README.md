# Hi, I'm Jermaine (Jay) 👋

### 🎓 MSc Software Systems Engineering @ UCL | 💻 First-Class BSc Computer Science

I am a 20-year-old **Software Engineer** based in London with a passion for **high-performance computing** and **algorithmic complexity**. I recently graduated with First-Class Honours and am currently specialising in Software Systems Engineering at University College London.

My work focuses on the intersection of complex math and efficient code, whether that's architecting low-latency trading engines or optimising graph traversal for mobile.

### 🔭 Featured Projects

#### 📈 **High-Performance Algorithmic Trading Engine**
* **Stack:** C++, Python, REST APIs
* **The Engineering:** Currently building a low-latency backtesting engine. I implemented **multithreading** to process massive financial time-series datasets, mimicking a real-time high-volume trading environment.
* **The Analysis:** Integrated a Python pipeline (Pandas/NumPy) to visualise trade performance and calculate risk metrics.

#### 📍 **CoRun: Pathfinding Optimisation System**
* **Stack:** TypeScript, React Native, Firebase, Expo
* **The Logic:** A mobile-deployed engine for solving multi-variable routing problems in dynamic environments.
* **The Math:** Led the implementation of a custom **weighted graph traversal algorithm ($A^*$)**, integrating heuristics like elevation and crowd density to outperform standard routing.
* **Performance:** Optimised the execution environment to handle complex graph calculations directly on mobile hardware.

### 💼 Experience

* **Freelance Software Engineer:** I architect reusable software components for clients, recently reducing deployment times by **20%** for internal tooling.
* **Frontend Developer (Intern) @ Outori:** Focused on the rendering pipeline, ensuring smooth **60fps** animations on lower-end mobile devices using React Native.

### ⚡ Offline

When I'm not debugging race conditions, you can find me:
* 🏎️ Analysing **Formula 1** strategies.
* 🧩 Solving **Sudoku** puzzles.
* 🏌🏽‍♂️ Playing Golf, 🎾 Tennis, or 🏀 Basketball.
